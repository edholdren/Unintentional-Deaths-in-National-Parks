# Unintentional Deaths in U.S. National Parks and Nationwide Death Statistics (2007-2023)

## Overview
This project analyzes unintentional deaths in U.S. national parks from 2007 to 2023, comparing them to nationwide unintentional death statistics over the same period. The focus is on five key causes of death: drowning, poisoning, falls, motor vehicle crashes, and a consolidated "other" category. The analysis explores annual trends for each cause and examines how much each cause contributes to the overall number of unintentional deaths in both national parks and the general U.S. population.

This comparison provides valuable insights into the unique risk profiles of national park visitors versus the broader U.S. population, potentially informing safety initiatives and resource planning for national parks.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project include:

1. **National Park Death Data**: Sourced from the National Park Service Mortality Dashboard and Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) Portal, this dataset covers unintentional deaths in U.S. national parks from 2007 to 2023.
   - **Cause of Death**: Drowning, Poisoning, Falls, Motor Vehicle Crashes, Other
   - **Annual Death Counts**: The total number of unintentional deaths per cause each year.

2. **Nationwide Death Data**: Sourced from the CDC WISQARS Leading Causes of Death database, this dataset includes nationwide statistics on unintentional deaths for the same time period (2007-2023).
   - **Cause of Death**: Drowning, Poisoning, Falls, Motor Vehicle Crashes, Other
   - **Annual Death Counts**: The total number of unintentional deaths per cause each year in the U.S.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to compare trends in unintentional deaths between U.S. national parks and the general U.S. population. Key objectives include:
1. Analyzing the annual trends of unintentional deaths in national parks.
2. Comparing these trends to nationwide unintentional death statistics.
3. Examining the contribution of each cause of death to the overall total in both datasets.
4. Identifying significant differences in the risk profiles of national park visitors versus the general public.

This analysis aims to provide insights that could inform future national park safety strategies and resource planning.
